# Workout Daily

Backend designed to provide the creation and monitoring of a user's workouts. This service was developed in **Clojure**, using the **Ring** and **Compojure** libraries. In addition, data is stored and accessed in a PostgreSQL database using the Korma library.

## Usage

### Database Configuration

Before you can start using it, you must configure the PostgreSQL database on the machine, so you can follow the sequence of steps described in the sql file: [configure_db](http://www.github.com/ThaynanAndrey/workout_daily/tree/master/src/workout_daily/config/database/configure_db.sql).

### Execution

To run the system, just run:   
    ```bash
        lein ring server
    ```
